Translation phases
1) Raw sourcec code 
   (a) replace trigraphs.
        ??=	#	hash
        ??(	[	left bracket
        ??/	\	backslash
        ??)	]	right bracket
        ??'	^	caret
        ??<	{	left brace
        ??!	| pipe
        ??>	}	right brace
        ??- ~ tilde
       Trigraphs are obsolete in c11 and removed in c23 altogether
   (b) make sure source code characters are in [0x00,0xFF] (utf-8).
   (c) optionally you can replace
       (a) \r\n with \n
       (b) \r with   \n
       (c) \f with   ' '.
       This optional. Instead you can take [\r\t\f\v] as white space
       during lexing.
2) Remove \\\n
   It's a guaranteed feature in ISO C (across all versions).
   Note : replace the digraphs 
    %:	  by #
    %:%:	by ##
3) Replace //.* and /*...*/ with empty spaces of equal length
4) Preprocessing # directives.
5) Concatenate {STRING}({WS}*{STRING})* into a single string
6) Lexing and parsing (AST creation) and compiling.
   Note : apart from the most common C-lexicons don't forget to parse
   the following digraphs during lexing
    <%	Digraph	for {
    %>	Digraph	for }
    <:	Digraph	for [
    :>	Digraph	for ]
   These digraphs are still used and not yet removed in any of the
   later versions of C
