/*
.. Given an NFA (Q, Σ, δ, q0 , F ) there exists
.. atleast one partition P (Σ), which satisfy the condition ( cond-1 )
.. ∀ p[i] ∈ P and c, c′ ∈ p[i]   ⇒   δ(q, c) = δ(q, c′)  ∀  q ∈ Q
.. Now, the equivalence class is the function
.. C(c) : Σ → {0, 1, ..., |P| − 1} which maps c to p[i]
.. i.e.   C(c) = i ⇐⇒ c ∈ p[i]
..
.. The aim of evaluating equivalence classes is (a) to reduce 
.. the size of transition (nfa->next[]) table from |Σ| to |P|, and 
.. (b) to reduce the computational cost in the algorithms like
.. Hopcroft minimization ( O (m⋅n⋅log(n)) ) where m is the
.. size of equivalence class, and n is the number of dfa states.
.. So our aim is to look for the coarsest partition, or the one
.. that satisfy above condition (cond-1) and minimises |P(Σ)|.
..
.. We initialize ( class_init() )  with
.. P ← {Σ}
.. for each character group S, we refine P ( class_refine() ) as :
..    P ← { Y ∩ S, Y ∖ S ∣ Y ∈ P } ∖ { ∅ }
..
.. In the above algorithm, S, is a character set
.. like [a-z], [^0-9], etc.
.. Neglect intersection set or difference set, if empty.
..
.. Creating equivalence class for negated character class [^..], works
.. same way for non-negated class []. It is because the refining algo,
.. class_refine (), has similar effect. If ¬S := Σ∖S, is the 
.. complement of S, then : Y ∩ ¬S = Y ∖ S, and Y ∖ ¬S = Y ∩ S.
